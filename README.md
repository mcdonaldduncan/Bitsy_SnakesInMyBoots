# Bitsy_SnakesInMyBoots

This bitsy game is meant to highlight some of the pressing issues concerning venomous snakes and their perception among people. Snakes are widely seen as villains and are often killed on sight in some parts of the world where they exist as a threat to local communities. While venomous snakes can be incredibly deadly and must be treated with respect, they are not evil and do not wish to harm humans. In fact, according to one ER nurse, 95% of all snake bites occur when a human tries to kill a snake. This bitsy experience aims to educate people on these realities by placing them in an experience where they can succeed by simply not going out of their way to harm the snakes. If they do attempt to harm the snakes, they might succeed a few times but eventually it will be their downfall. The UX was accomplished through the use of a branching list on multiple snake items. When interacting with the snakes, the player will succesfully kill the snake the first few times they try, each snake killed will increment a variable tracking the number of snakes killed. Eventually, if they continue to harm the snakes, one will succesfully bite the player, resulting in their death.
